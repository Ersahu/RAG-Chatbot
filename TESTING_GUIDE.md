### **Step 2: Upload a Test Document**

#### **Option A: Use the Test Document I Created**

1. Click on **"Documents"** button in the sidebar
2. Click **"Upload Document"**
3. Select the file: `test-document.txt` from:
   ```
   C:\Users\royal\OneDrive\Desktop\guigghfyfy\test-document.txt
   ```
4. Wait for upload to complete

#### **Option B: Use Your Own Document**

Supported formats:
- ✅ PDF files
- ✅ DOCX files
- ✅ TXT files
- ⚠️ Max size: 10MB

**What Happens During Upload:**
1. ⏳ File is uploaded to server
2. ⏳ Text is extracted from the document
3. ⏳ Text is split into chunks (1000 characters each)
4. ⏳ Embeddings are generated (using Hugging Face)
5. ⏳ Vectors are stored in database
6. ✅ Document ready for questioning!

**Note**: First upload may take 20-30 seconds due to Hugging Face model cold start.

### **Step 3: Ask Questions About Your Document**

Once the document is uploaded, try these test questions:

#### **For the AI Test Document:**

1. **"What is Artificial Intelligence?"**
   - Should explain AI as a branch of computer science

2. **"Who are the key researchers in AI?"**
   - Should list: Alan Turing, John McCarthy, Geoffrey Hinton, etc.

3. **"What are the types of AI?"**
   - Should mention: Narrow AI, General AI, Superintelligent AI

4. **"What are the applications of AI in healthcare?"**
   - Should mention: disease diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized medicine

5. **"What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?"**
   - Should explain both concepts based on the document

#### **For Your Own Documents:**

Ask specific questions about the content of your uploaded document.

### **Step 4: Understanding the Responses**

Each response will include:

1. **Answer**: Generated by Mistral-7B based on your documents
2. **Sources**: Which documents were used to generate the answer
3. **Relevance Score**: How relevant each source was

**Example Response:**
```
Answer: Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses 
on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks requiring human 
intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and 
decision-making.

Sources:
• test-document.txt (Relevance: 0.85)
```

## ⚠️ Known Behaviors

### **First Request Timing:**
- **First question**: 20-30 seconds (Hugging Face model cold start)
- **Subsequent questions**: 2-5 seconds

### **Rate Limits (Hugging Face Free Tier):**
- **1000 requests per day**
- If you hit the limit, you'll see an error message
- Wait 24 hours or upgrade to Pro

### **Document Processing:**
- Small documents (< 1MB): 5-10 seconds
- Large documents (5-10MB): 30-60 seconds
- Very large documents may fail (max 10MB)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Upload Failed"**

**Check:**
1. File format (PDF, DOCX, TXT only)
2. File size (< 10MB)
3. Backend is running
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Fix:**
- Restart backend: `npm run dev` in backend folder
- Try smaller file
- Convert PDF to TXT if it's image-based

---

### **"No Answer Generated"**

**Possible Causes:**
1. Document not fully processed
2. Question not related to document content
3. Hugging Face rate limit exceeded

**Fix:**
- Wait for upload to complete
- Refresh page and try again
- Check backend logs for errors

---

### **"Rate Limit Exceeded"**

**Fix:**
- Wait 1 minute and try again
- Check Hugging Face usage: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- Consider upgrading to Pro tier

## 🎯 Advanced Testing

### **Test Multiple Documents:**

1. Upload 2-3 different documents
2. Ask questions that require information from multiple documents
3. Verify sources show which documents were used

### **Test Conversation History:**

1. Ask several questions
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if conversation is preserved
4. Navigate to "Conversations" to see history

### **Test Edge Cases:**

1. Upload empty file (should fail gracefully)
2. Ask question with no documents uploaded
3. Ask question unrelated to documents
4. Upload very large document (near 10MB limit)

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### **Good Performance:**
- ✅ Answers directly from document content
- ✅ Cites specific sources
- ✅ Responds in 2-5 seconds (after first request)
- ✅ Handles follow-up questions

### **Expected Limitations:**
- ⚠️ May not answer questions outside document scope
- ⚠️ First request takes longer (cold start)
- ⚠️ Limited to 512 tokens per response
- ⚠️ May occasionally provide incomplete answers

## 🔄 How RAG Works (Behind the Scenes)

When you ask a question:

1. **Your Question** → Converted to vector embedding
2. **Semantic Search** → Finds 4 most relevant chunks from your documents
3. **Context Building** → Combines relevant chunks
4. **LLM Prompt** → Sends context + question to Mistral-7B
5. **Answer Generation** → AI generates answer based only on your documents
6. **Source Attribution** → Shows which documents were used

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Upload relevant documents** - AI can only answer from what you upload
2. **Ask specific questions** - More focused questions get better answers
3. **Be patient on first request** - Model needs to warm up
4. **Check sources** - Verify the AI used correct documents
5. **Try rephrasing** - If answer is unclear, ask differently
